Data-Driven Chemistry is a collection of learning material for an introductory Python course for undergraduate chemistry students. The presented material here serves as a public version of [Data-Driven Chemistry](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/22-23/dpt/cxchem08031.htm) as taught at the University of Edinburgh in the School of Chemistry.

## Dependencies

This project uses the Python programming language, and requires Python >= 3.9.

Units are written and available as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

Units will require different packages from the scientific Python ecosystem. The easiest way to install dependencies is using the Anaconda distribution, otherwise the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file also summarises the needed packages. 

## Authors and their contributions:

- James Cumby (JC)
- Valentina Erastova (VE)
- Matteo Degiacomi (MTD)
- Jasmin Güven (JJG)
- Claire Hobday (CLH)
- Antonia Mey (ASJSM)

Authors are listed in alphabetical order; specific contributions by each author are found in the following: James Cumby (JC), Valentina Erastova (VE), Claire L. Hobday (CLH), and Antonia Mey (ASJSM) have been teaching this course at the University of Edinburgh since the academic year 2021/22. See below for their detailed contributions. Rafał Szabla (RS) taught one unit and created content for it in 2020/21, when the course was run in a shortened form as a replacement for physical chemistry laboratory practicals during the pandemic. Matteo T Degiacomi (MTD) shared materials, developed in 2018 for his course at Durham University aimed at chemistry research students from which material was adapted. He made some additional contributions beyond his original material.

JC: Is the course organiser for the module taught at the University of Edinburgh and created the material for Unit_01, Unit_10 and the helper_functions, gave feedback on other materials, and helped edit the manuscript.    
MTD: Contributed material to `Unit_03`, `Unit_05` and `Unit_08`, and helped edit the manuscript.    
VE: Created material for `Unit_05` and `Unit_08`, contributed to `Unit_06`, and helped edit the manuscript.   
JJG: Contributed material to `Unit_09`, and helped edit the manuscript.   
CLH: Created material for `Unit_03` and `Unit_04`, and helped edit the manuscript.    
ASJSM: Created material for `Unit_02`, `Unit_06`, `Unit_07`, and `Unit_09`, provided feedback and small contributions to most other units, and wrote the manuscript.   
HP: Contributed material to `Unit_05` and  `Unit_08`, and helped edit the manuscript.   
RS: Created the material for molecular geometries forming part of `Unit_06` and gave feedback on the manuscript.   

## Acknowledgements

## Reusing and building on the material for your own course

The easiest way is by cloning the material and adapting it to your needs. This can be just using some partial material or expanding on the existing material. The best way to do this is by either [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repo (which will include the full project history), or using the current repository as a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Either way, you will have a copy of this project in your own (or organisations) account.
